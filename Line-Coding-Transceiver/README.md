# Line-coding-Transciver
Line coding is a technique which is used to transmit a bit stream using a channel. There are several 
globally recognized standard line-coding schemes available in the world. This paper focuses on the 
development and implementation of a simplex line coding transceiver based on analog components 
and ICâ€™s such as OpAmps, transistors and signal generating ICs. This project aims to accomplish 
data between two microcontrollers via a pair of twisted wires transmission with a data length of 1000 
bits at a minimum data rate of 10 kb/s
